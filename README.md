# Web-based Attendance System with Object Detection

This project is a **Web-based Attendance System** prototype that leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a machine learning model for object detection. The system is designed to automate the process of attendance tracking by recognizing faces and verifying identities in real-time using object detection technology. All administrative tasks and attendance management are handled through a user-friendly web interface.

## üìú Features

- **Object Detection with YOLO**: Utilizes the YOLO machine learning model for detecting faces and confirming identities in images or video streams.
- **Real-time Attendance Tracking**: Automates attendance marking by detecting and recording individuals' presence without manual input.
- **Web-based Management**: Provides a web interface to manage attendance records, generate reports, and configure system settings.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user login for secure access to the admin panel where attendance data can be managed and reviewed.
- **Attendance Reports**: Generates detailed attendance reports that can be exported for further analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For real-time object detection.
- **Flask**: Backend web framework for managing data, authentication, and attendance logic.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Front-end technologies for creating an intuitive user interface.
- **MySQL**: Database management for storing attendance data and user information.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing during object detection.
